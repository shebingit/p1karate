          <h2 class="text-center mb-3">KATA</h2>   
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Kata</b> is often described as a set sequence of karate moves organized into a pre-arranged fight against imaginary opponents. The kata consists of kicks, punches, sweeps, strikes, blocks, and throws. Body movement in various kata includes stepping, twisting, turning, dropping to the ground, and jumping. In Shotokan, kata is not a performance or a demonstration, but is for individual karateka to practice full techniquesâ€”with every technique potentially a killing blow; while paying particular attention to form and timing (rhythm).
            Shotokan Karate is comprised of 26 katas, each with their own emphasis on fast and slow or controlled and powerfull movements. Virtually all of the katas taught today in the Shotokan system have two kiai points.
            The kiai or "spirit cry" as it is sometimes referred to, occurs only at certain pre-determined moments in each kata. It is precisely at these pre-determined moments that the karate-ka is required to demonstrate a total commitment of body, mind, and spirit, and to channel all of their available energy and apply it appropriately to the required technique. The kiai is a common thread that runs through all major styles of karate.

                The Geki Sai Kata were formulated by Chojun Miyagi Sensei in 1940 as a form of physical exercise for high school boys and to 
                help popularize Goju-Ryu among the public of Okinawa. In 1948, after WWII, Miyagi Sensei began to teach the Geki Sai Kata in depth as a regular part of Goju-Ryu in his own dojo. 
                Until this time, Sanchin was the first Kata taught in Goju-Ryu. Sanchin Kata is physically and mentally a demanding Kata and 
                requires a great deal of time and patience to learn and perform properly. The Geki Sai Kata however are easier to learn and perform,
                and contain dynamic techniques which are more attractive to young people. These Kata contain the same kanji Katas found in Saifa. 
                This would suggest that even though these Kata were designed primarily as a form of exercise, Miyagi Sensei included his understanding
                of combat as part of their makeup.

              <p>
                Saifa is the first of the classical combative Kata taught in Goju-Ryu. 
                Goju-Ryu's Kata origins come from the martial arts taught in the Fuzhou area of southern China,
                largely Crane and Xingyi/Baqua as well as other internal and external martial arts.
                Kanryo Higaonna Sensei was taught this Kata, along with the other Kata of Goju-Ryu,
                while he studied in China from 1863-1881 under the direction of RuRuKo ( Xie Zhong Xiang in Chinese) and others. 
                These Kata and martial strategies would become the basis of the the quanfa of Higaonna Sensei,
                which later Miyagi Sensei would call Goju-Ryu. From an understanding of the grappling
                and strking techniques of this Kata, Saifa can be interpreted to mean grabbing and tearing of tissue in close-quartered combat.

                Sanchin translates as "3 Battles" or "3 Conflicts". This has many meanings. 
                First it refers to the struggle to control the body under physical fatigue. 
                With fatigue the mind begins to lose focus and thus the spirit begins to diminsh as well. 
                Therefore Sanchin develops discipline, determination, focus, perserverance and other mental attributes. 
                The Chinese refer to this as Shen (spirit), Shin (mind) and Li (body). Another possible interpretation 
                refers to the "Three Burners" of the body as decribed in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM).

              <p>
                One of two "heishu " Kata of Goju-Ryu, Sanchin is probably the most misunderstood Kata
                in all of Karate. In contrast, it is probably the single most valuable training exercise in Goju-Ryu. 
                Like the other Kata of Goju-Ryu, Sanchin ( Samm Chien in Chinese) can be found in several Chinese arts, 
                particulary the southern styles including four styles of Crane Boxing, Dragon Boxing, Tiger Boxing, Lion Boxing, 
                Dog or Ground Boxing and Monk Fist. Sanchin has such aspects as deep, diaphramatic breathing found in many internal 
                arts as well as external attributes like mechanical alignment and muscular strength.
              </p>
              <p>
                Because many martial artists have little or no understanding of the true history and nature of the Chinese 
                arts from which Okinawan Goju-Ryu has its roots, Sanchin has become little more than an isometric form performed 
                with dangerous tension and improper breathing techniques.
              </p>
              <p>
                The original Sanchin that Higaonna Sensei learned from RuRuKo (1852-1930) was performed with open hands and
                with less emphasis on muscle contraction and "energetic" breathing. With the changes brought about by 
                Emperor Meiji (Meiji Restoration Period 1888-1912), Higaonna Sensei changed the open hands to closed fists as the 
                martial meaning was no longer emphasized. Later Miyagi Sensei would again alter the Kata in pattern alone.

              <p>
                The name Seiunchin implies the use of techniques to off balance, throw and grapple. 
                It is this understanding that imparts the original intentions of the Kata of Naha-te before the 
                sport alignment of modern Karate. Seiyunchin contains close-quartered striking, sweeps, 
                take-downs and throws. Though the Kata itself is void of kicks, many practitioners make 
                the grave mistake by missing the opportunity to apply any leg technique. Though almost invisible 
                to the untrained eye, the subtleness of "ashi barai" and "suri ashi" can represent footsweeps, parries and traps.

              <p>
                eave it at that discounts a truer understanding. The third kanjiShisochin is the 
                same found in Sanchin and Seiyunchin, which translates as "battle" or "conflict". 
                This lends to a deeper definition of its meaning. The idea of four directions can 
                come from the performance of the four shotei in four directions. It can also represent 
                the four elements represented in Chinese medicine (Acupuncture is one) of Wood, Fire, 
                Metal and Water with man representing Earth. Since this was the science and culture 
                of that period in China when Higaonna and Miyagi both studied in Fuzhou, it would be 
                a great oversight to discount this aspect as a very probable explanation of the Kata's name and martial intent.

              <p>
                Sanseru is unique as Miyagi Sensei studied this Kata under a direct student of RuRuKo during his studies 
                in Fuzhou, China beginning in 1916. Sanseru, from its numerical designation, would seem to have its roots 
                in Buddhism. This is not to infer that there is a religious connection or implication with this Kata or Karate, 
                but simply that Buddhism was a part of the culture of the people of that time. It should also be noted that numbers 
                had a very important role in the language of the more ancient Chinese before the invention of kanji.

                A more realistic explanation of this and the other numerically named Kata is that they refer to a systematic method 
                and understanding of certain groupings of vital acupressure points. 
                It is this science that the martial arts was based upon and developed.

              <p>
                Feng Yiquan, who lived during the Ming Dynasty (1522-67) developed this particular method of using variations of 
                "36" forbidden points to defeat his opponents. Other disciples 
                of Feng created other quans expanding the number to 72 and ultimately 108.

              <p>
                The reference to "18" in naming this Kata has a couple of interpretations. Like Sanseru, there 
                is suggested a connection to Buddhist philosophy. Another insinuates "18 guards for the King". 
                The most apparent and most meaningful in the naimg of Sepai is again from the martial arts develpoment and 
                the use of attacking pressure points. 18 is one half of 36 suggesting that perhaps an alternative set of attacks 
                and defenses of preferred techniques and strategies from the original Sanseru 36.

                Kururunfa epitomizes the ideals of Go-"hard and Ju-"soft". Stance transitions are quick and 
                explosive while the hands techniques are employed using "muchimi" or a heavy, sticky movement. 
                As in the other kata of Goju-Ryu, it is quite evident that grappling and close-quartered fighting is 
                the favored fighting style. The same kanji Kururunfa is found in Saifa. Again, this would suggest a 
                strong empahsis on grappling. Where most other styles' Kata concentrate on "block/punch", it is obvious 
                from the unique techniques that this is not the case with Goju-Ryu.

                Seisan, Sanseru and Sepai all share the kanji Seisan . This may well be a Chinese dialect of the Okinawan 
                term "te" or "fighting hand", referring to life-protection techniques. To better understand these Kata 
                requires a more defined understanding of the language and culture of the people from which these Kata originated.
              </p>
              <p>
                Seisan is believed to be the oldest of all Okinawan Goju-Ryu Kata. There is a version of Seisan practiced 
                in the Shorin schools, but in comparison, the Goju-Ryu version is longer and much more complex.Seisan is practiced in the following styles of Chinese Boxing: Dragon, Lion and Monk Fist

              <p>
                Suparinpei is the most advanced Kata in Goju-Ryu. It contains the greatest number of techniques and variations. 
                Suparinpei is deceptive in that it appears simple in execution but when combined with transitions and changing tempos, 
                it is only surpassed by Sanchin in technical difficulty and understanding. Once again, the number "108" is suggested to 
                have origins in Buddhism and can represent the "108 sins of man". On the Chinese New Year, temple bells are rung 108 times 
                to "drive away the evils of man". It is believed these named associations with Buddhism is based upon the lack of factual 
                knowledge of the true nature of these quan.

              <p>
                Secondly, with the cutural changes that took place in China during and after the Boxing Rebellion (1900) and the fall 
                of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), little emphasis was placed on learning such complex arts. Most who learned the fighting 
                arts after this time, did so as a means of exercise, recreation or artistic performance. In additon, the wide-spread use 
                of firearms reduced the need and effectiveness for hand-to-hand combat as a means to civil defense.
                Suparinpei is found in the following styles of Chinese Boxing: Dragon, Tiger and Monk Fist.

              <p>
                The second "heishu" kata in Goju-Ryu, Tensho is derived from the Chinese form "Rokkishu". 
                Unlike Sanchin, which is almost identical to its Chinese counterpart, Tensho is uniquely Okinawan. 
                From his understanding of the Kata of Goju-Ryu and the "nature of man", Miyagi Sensei developed 
                Tensho to further complete his Goju-Ryu where Sanchin left off. Tensho has many of the same principles 
                of Sanchin but goes further to include more intricate concepts of the techniques of Goju-Ryu. These concepts 
                expressly come alive in kakie , which in advanced training, breathes life into the bunkai of the Kata of Goju-Ryu.
              </p>
              <p>
                The term "heishu" translates as "closed". As with every aspect of Okinawan Karate, there is more than one definition. First, "heishu" 
                can refer to muscle contraction and "ibuki" style breathing unique to Sanchin and Tensho.
              </p>
              <p>
                econdly, it can imply the restriction and specific direction of energies within the energy 
                pathways of the body, both superficial and deep. The other 10 Kata are referred to as "kaishu" or "open", 
                as they are free of constant muscle contraction and breathing is "normal".
