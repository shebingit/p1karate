            <h4 class="text-primary">Grandmaster Kanryo Higashionna Founder of Naha-te Karate-jutsu (1853 - 1915)</h4>
            <p style="color: #000;"><span>Grandmaster Kanryo Higaonna </span>(Higashionna was the original Okinawan pronounciation) was born on March 10, 1853, 
              in Naha, the capital city of Okinawa. His father, Kanyo, worked as a merchant sailing between the small islands of Okinawa trading 
              everyday goods. From a young age Kanryo Higaonna helped his father in this work and through the hard physical labor that was involved 
              he developed a strong body. Kanryo Higaonna was still in his teens when his father died suddenly.   
            </p>
            <p>
              Higaonna began his martial arts training in 1867 in Monk Fist Boxing (Lohan Quan) from Aragaki Seisho. In 1870, 
              at the age of 16, he traveled with his instructor to Fuzhou, China. Once in Fuzhou he studied the Chinese martial 
              arts under the great Master RuRuKo (Xie Zhonh Xiang in Chinese). RuRuKo was the founder of Whooping Crane gongfu 
              and was a student of Pan Yuba who, in turn, was a student of Lin Shixian, a master of White Crane gongfu. Higaonna 
              also received instruction from numerous other gongfu masters including Wai Xinxian. Hiagaonna remained in China 
              for a period of 5-13 years. In addition to studying empty hand and weapon arts, he also became accomplished in 
              herbology and Chinese medicine, including acupuncture.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-12 col-md-6 col-sm-12"></div>
           
            <p>
              Chojun Miyagi (founder of Goju-Ryu and successor to Higaonna) said of Higaonna, "My sensei possessed incredible strength; 
              the severity of the training he underwent in China is beyond comprehension.... Kanryo Sensei's speed and power were truly 
              superhuman; his hands and feet moved faster than lightning". Words cannot express his real ability. We can only say that 
              his skill was incredible, but even this fails to do him justice.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the year 1881, he returned to Okinawa where his martial arts would become known as Naha-te though he always referred to
              it as chuanfa. Kanryo Higaonna taught these martial arts to the people of Okinawa and at the same time continued his own 
              research and practice. In order to teach the youth of Okinawa he developed a teaching method that was specifically designed
              to develop the mind and body; to improve both physical well-being.
            </p>
            <p>
              The first occasion on which the previously secretive art of Naha-te "opened" to society in general, occurred in October 1905, 
              when Higaonna began teaching at the Naha Commercial High School. When teaching, Higaonna was an extremely hard task master. 
              However, in his everyday life he was a quiet and humble man and one who was renowned for his virtuous character. He was a 
              person who had no need or desire for worldly things. He leads a simple life that was devoted to the study and practice of 
              martial arts.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are many stories that relate tales of Kanryo Higaonna's life and training. The power of his legs was legendary so that
              often he was referred to as "Ashi no Higaonna", ("legs Higaonna") in Okinawa. His virtuous character was widely known and respected,
              and because of his popularity the people of Naha bestowed him with the name, Obushi Higaonna Tanmei:, a name which reflected the 
              affection and respect they had for this great man and supreme martial artist.
            </p>
            <p>
              Kanryo Higaonna's unparalleled skill in the martial arts aside, his great and distinguished work was in bringing the Chinese martial arts 
              from China to Okinawa, and from there spreading these arts among the people of Okinawa.<br>
              Kanryo Higaonna is now bestowed with the title "Kensei (sacred fists) Kanryo Higaonna" a title which is eminently fitting. His name is 
              synonymous with Okinawan martial arts and Naha-te, and his spirit is destined to live on forever as a great and valued treasure within Okinawan culture.<br>
              Kanryo Higaonna's whole life was devoted to karate. He passed away in December 1915 at the age of 63.

              <h4 class="text-primary">Chojun Miyagi (1888 - 1953)</h4>
              <p style="color: #000;"><span>Chojun Miyagi</span> was born on April 25,1888. He began his Karate training in Shuri-te and at 
                the age of 14 was introduced to Kanryo Higaonna with whom he began his study of Naha-te. Like his teacher before him, 
                because of his great natural talent and fierce determination, he progressed very rapidly. The training was severe beyond 
                belief at times but he practiced ever harder with an enthusiasm unmatched by any of the other students. Chojun Miyagi 
                became "uchi deshi" (private discipline) of Kanryo Higaonna. He studied with his teacher for 14 years before his teacher's 
                death in 1915.
              </p>
              <p>
                Chojun Miyagi, as successor to his teacher's "te", pushed himself to the limits of endurance in his desire to 
                emulate his teacher's extraordinary skill. In 1915 he journeyed to Fuzhou, China, the city where his teacher had 
                studied martial arts to further his research. This was one of three trips he made to China during his lifetime.
              </p>
              <p>
                On his return to Okinawa he began to teach the martial arts out of his home in Naha. Later, he also taught at 
                the Okinawan Prefecture Police Training Center, at the Okinawan Master's Training College, and at the Naha Commercial 
                High School (where his teacher had once taught).
              </p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="col-lg-12 col-md-6 col-sm-12">
              <p>
                Chojun Miyagi worked hard to spread Karate throughout Okinawa and mainland Japan, and to earn his toudi a 
                status equal to that of the highly respected Japanese martial arts of Judo and Kendo. To achieve this he 
                traveled frequently to mainland Japan where he was invited to teach at Kyoto University, Kansai University 
                and Ritsumei Kan University. In 1933, Goju-Ryu Karate was the first Okinawan martial art to be registered 
                with the Dai Nippon Butoku-Kai, the center for all martial arts in Japan. This was a milestone for Karate 
                as it meant it would aligned with the highly respected martial arts of Japan.
              </p>
              <p>
                Chojun Miyagi dedicated his whole life to Karate. He was responsible for structuring his toudi 
                (which he later named Goju-Ryu) into a systemized discipline which could be taught to society in general. 
                This teaching system that he formulated enabled Karate to be taught in schools for the benefit of the young, 
                and to reach vast numbers of people throughout the world. However, his private teaching at his home remained 
                strictly in adherence to the principles and traditions of his teacher, Kanryo Higaonna, and his teacher before him, 
                RuRuKo.
              </p>
              <p>
                The naming of Goju-Ryu came about more by accident than by design. In 1930, Chojun Miyagi's top student, 
                Jin'an Shinzato, while in Tokyo demostrating the Karate of his teacher, was asked as to what school of martial 
                arts he practiced. As Naha-te had no formal name he could not answer this question. On his return to Okinawa he 
                reported this incident to Chojun Miyagi. After much consideration, Chojun Miyagi chose the name Goju-Ryu 
                (hard and soft school) as a name for his style. This name he took from a line in the "Bubishi" 
                (a classical text on martial arts and other subjects) is shown below. This line reads, "Ho Goju Donto". 
                It is necessary to point out that these precepts have a much greater importance than simply as the source 
                for the naming on Goju-ryu. They present great insight into the indispensable knowledge and application of 
                the sciences practiced by the martial arts masters of this time. Without proper and complete research and 
                study of these paradiagms, the true essence of Goju-ryu can never be truely understood.

              <h4 class="text-primary">Miyazato Ei'ichi Hanshi (1922 - 1999)</h4>
              <p>
                <span>Ei'ichi Miyazato</span> (1922-1999) was recognized as the highest authority on Okinawan Goju-Ryu Karate-Do 
                in the world after the death of of his teacher. He served as the senior most technical advisor for the 
                Japan Karate Federation Goju-Kai, the governing body for all Okinawan and Japanese Goju-Ryu Karate. 
                He was on the technical examination committee. Presently the JKF is amending the Kata for all Goju-Ryu s
                chools to follow that as taught within the Jundokan. Additionally, he was the chairman and technical director 
                for the World Jundokan Association, All Okinawa Karate-Do Federation. Additionally, he held a 7th Dan in Judo 
                through the Kodokan and was the president of the Okinawa Judo Federation until his passing.
              </p>
              <p>
                Miyazato Sensei began his training with Master Miyagi at the age of 13. Miyazato Sensei's father had himself 
                studied with Kanryo Higaonna and therefore Miyagi accepted the young Miyazato as a student. Except for a brief 
                time during WWII, Miyazato Sensei studied continuously with Master Miyagi. He was but only of a handful of the 
                original students that continued their training with Master Miyagi after the war.
              </p>
              <p>
                The same year that Master Miyagi passed away, a group of Miyagi's senior students that included Nakaima, Madanbashi, 
                Meitoki Yagi, Iha Koshin and Ei'ichi Miyazato came together to elect a successor for Goju-Ryu. The consensus of the group 
                was that Miyazato was the most qualified to succeed Chojun Miyagi due to his qualifications and because he had spent the 
                most continuous training time with Miyagi in the dojo and in the police department. Kei Miyagi, the second oldest son of 
                Master Miyagi was called to testify. He testified that Master Miyagi always said thst Miyazato was the only one he could 
                depend on for everything in the dojo. Miyazato accepted the responsibility and has dedicated his entire life to preserving 
                and spreading Okinawan Goju-Ryu throughout the world as taught by his teacher.
